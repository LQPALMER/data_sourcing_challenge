# data_sourcing_challenge

This file prepares some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies.  Data is extracted from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then the data is merged together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.

The activity is in 3 parts:
Part 1: Access the New York Times API.
Part 2: Access The Movie Database API.
Part 3: Merge and Clean the Data for Export.
